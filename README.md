Power BI report analyzing a survey of ~630 data professionals, covering:

- Salary by job title and country
- Favorite programming languages
- Difficulty breaking into data
- Work/life balance and salary satisfaction

The goal is to practice building a clean, interactive Power BI dashboard and to summarize key insights from the survey.

## Key Insights

- **Python** dominates as the favorite programming language among data professionals.
- Most respondents reported that **breaking into data was "difficult" or "very difficult"** for one third of participants. 
- Work/life balance and salary satisfaction are **moderately positive** (around 5–6 / 10 on average).
